# firebase_auth

** Things I would do if I had more time to spend to building this project-

1. I would implement the Hilt for dependency injection that will help to reduce creating instances and good app architecture, 
more excellent code reusability and ease of testing.
2. Remove all the redundant codes and methods from the project and try to use reusability. 
3. Check the possible cases for the exception and handle it.
4. Would follow SOLID principles to make the code reusable, readable, maintainable and scalable.
5. Would remove all the hard codes in the XML and use string.xml file. That will help to build multi-language apps.
6. Would add descriptions where needed like EditText and images for the accessibility feature.
7. Remove all the logs in Kt files. Because keeping it is not safe in the production app.
8. Remove any deprecated code and use the latest one.
